I start Chapter 2 with an introduction and elaborate the research questions, methods, research material, and a short overwies of the following chapters. I also discuss how the goal of the internship evolved over time and how it differed from the initial intentions. Then I move on to Chapter 3 the first round of analyses, namely principal component analysis (PCA), and report the results.

In Chapter @(fa) I apply exploratory-confirmatory factor analysis (E/CFA) and put th In Chapter @(sem) I model measurement errors and In Appendix @(esmclass) appendices I include the reproducible R scripts used for this project. This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. "]
